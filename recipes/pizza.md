## Instructions

Divide the total water in the recipe between 80% ice water and 20% warm water at about 90 F. In a small bowl combine yeast and the 20% warm water. Mix well until yeast is dissolved.

Combine flour and diastatic malt in bowl of stand mixer with dough hook. (You can also just mix by hand in a mixing bowl and skip the electric mixer.)

Add the remaining 80% of water (the ice water) to the bowl of the mixer, followed by the yeast-water mixture. Mix for about 1 minute until dough begins to come together. Incorporate any remaining bits of flour on the bottom of the bowl. If the dough is not holding together, add a small additional amount of water and mix until the dough holds together.

Add the salt and mix for 1 minute on low to combine.

Add the oil and mix for 1 to 2 minutes until all oil is absorbed. Stop the mixer as necessary to pull the dough off the hook. When mixed the dough will still look a bit rough and shaggy.

Transfer the dough to an unfloured work surface. A clean counter top is perfect. Knead the dough by hand for 2-3 minutes. Cover with a damp dish towel and let rest at room temperature for 20 minutes.

Using a dough cutter or knife, cut the dough into appropriate sized pieces and form the dough balls. Set the balls on a half sheet pan, spacing them about 3 inches apart. Cover the pan with a double layer of plastic wrap, sealing well under the pan. Put the pan(s) in a level spot in the refrigerator and refrigerate for 24 to 48 hours.

Remove the dough balls from the oven about 4-5 hours before you are ready to make pizzas.

**Diastatic malt** is a **key ingredient** and can be obtained from specialty baking vendors.
